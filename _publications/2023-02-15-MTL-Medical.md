This review focuses on the advanced applications of multitask deep learning (MTDL) for medical image computing and analysis. We first summarize four popular MTDL network architectures (i.e., cascaded, parallel, interacted, and hybrid). Then, we review the representative MTDL-based networks for eight application areas, including the brain, eye, chest, cardiac, abdomen, musculoskeletal, pathology, and other human body regions.
