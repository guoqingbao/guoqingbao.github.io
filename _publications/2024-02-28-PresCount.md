This paper introduces the novel register allocation method PresCount, which enhances the coloring strategy for the Register Conflict Graph (RCG) and incorporates a bank pressure tracking mechanism to improve performance. The integrated register bank assigner in PresCount effectively reduces bank conflicts, achieving remarkable reductions of 43.28% and 27.76%, respectively, compared to existing methods on platforms with rich register banks and limited register budgets, as demonstrated by SPECfp and CNN-KERNEL benchmarks. Furthermore, a subgroup splitting technique is introduced to facilitate register allocation under the bank-subgroup register file design, specifically our Domain-Specific Architecture (DSA) for AI computing.
