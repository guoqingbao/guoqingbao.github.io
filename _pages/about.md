About
======
* Since 2022, Dr. Bao has been working as a Senior Staff Researcher specializing in ML framework & ML systems.

* Starting from October 2022, he received the Shanghai Pujiang Program Award from the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, where he served as the Project Lead for a 2-year research project in artificial intelligence and heterogeneous computing.
  
* With a rich background in both university research and software engineering, he possess the capability to rapidly prototype and commercially implement innovative ideas.

* He has accumulated six years of full-time research experience in the fields of computer vision, deep learning, and medical informatics, alongside an additional nine years of industry work experience as a senior software engineer, involving the development and architectural design of large-scale commercial software projects.

* Academic and industry achievements spanning from 2008 to 2021:

  * 2016-2021:

    * He earned outstanding academic achievements, including high honor rolls, half-fee scholarships, summer research opportunities, placement on the dean's list, as well as Ph.D. and postgraduate supplementary scholarships, during his time as a Master's and Ph.D. student at the University of Sydney. He published high-quality scientific papers in the fields of machine learning, pattern recognition, and translational medicine in journals such as Pattern Recognition, IEEE JBHI, Cancers, and Lancet family journals.

  * 2008-2016:

    * Took on a key role in the architecture design and development of a cross-platform video streaming system at iQiYi.com. His contributions included the creation and implementation of a universal video streaming system, which remains in stable operation across hundreds of millions of mobile devices, PCs, and smart TVs. This model successfully supported more than one billion daily video views and improved the video view success rate on the iQiYi platform by over 6% since 2014.

    * Pioneered the technical solution for streaming iQiYi's video and advertising content on third-party platforms, a milestone that led to a 300-million-dollar investment by China's top smartphone manufacturer, Xiaomi, for video content collaboration in late 2014.

    * Developed a human-machine interaction and video-on-demand solution for early-stage Internet TV (Smart TV), using Windows as the simulation platform. This groundbreaking design and solution have since become the standard reference for many Android streaming clients since 2012. The design and streaming solution have been widely adopted by hundreds of millions of Smart TV and TVBox devices since 2013.
