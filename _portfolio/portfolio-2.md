**Research Assistant & Academic Tutor** in School of Computer Science, The University of Sydney, 

I'm doing research work in which I analyzing medical data with the help of image processing, machine/deep learning (Sklearn, Keras and PyTorch), visual and statistical analysis.

(1) Analyses medical imaging data and genomic big data based on machine learning/deep learning. 

(2) Design and implement machine learning models that can harness medical big data for disease diagnosis. 

(3) Write and publish high-quality scientific papers on computer vision, pattern recognition, machine learning, and translational medicine related areas. 

(4) Improve the performance of deep learning algorithms in medical image recognition and genomic data processing.

(5) Research and improve computer vision algorithms (such as image detection, segmentation, registration, etc.) for pathology and CT image data analysis.


The machine learning models involved in my projects include but are not limited to: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forests, Light GBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Generative Adversarial Network) etc. Machine learning and data analysis frameworks include PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow, Sklearn, Numpy, Pandas, OpenCV, Matplotlib, etc.

I ran tutorials and mentored undergraduate and master students in courses like SOFT3413, COMP5615 (Software Development Project), INFO3600 (Major Development Project (Advanced)), COMP9103 (Software Development in Java) and COMP5415 (Multimedia Design and Authoring), in School of Computer Science, The University of Sydney.
